            I was born in California, although I have lived in many places
            across the United States, ranging from Colorado to Alabama, and now
            Nebraska. For high school, I attended Enterprise High School in
            Enterprise, Alabama; I graduated in spring 2018. I am currently
            attending the University of Alabama, majoring in Computer Science
            and Mathematics. I am doing undergraduate research as part of the
            <a

            >
              Randall Research Scholars Program</a
            >, an honors interdisciplinary undergraduate research program. (Fun
            Fact: Nan Boden, the COO of Robotics Moonshot at X, is an alumna of
            this same program). Currently, I am interested in an academic
            computer science career, focusing on parallel and distributed
            systems and theoretical computer science.

            I started programming at age 15, when I took a robotics course at my
            high school. I soon joined my school's VEX robotics team. Through my
            participation in robotics, I discovered that I hate mechanical
            engineering, and I thus narrowed down my major choices to computer
            engineering or computer science. I further narrowed my choice down
            to computer science when I realized that computer science was not
            merely about software development; it is a broader way of thinking
            about the world. I became particularly interested in an academic
            career upon both doing research in high performance computing and
            reading more about theoretical computer science on my own time. I
            also added a major in Mathematics to give me a better foundation for
            the mathematical aspects of these areas of computer science.
            However, I have decided to do Google's STEP internship this summer
            (summer 2020) to round off my computer science experience.

            In addition to my academic and professional work, I am also involved
            in several organizations across my university. I am currently the
            head of competitive programming -- we attended the ACM Southeast
            Programming Competition last fall. I am also involved in social
            events for my university's ACM chapter, as well as the Randall
            Research Scholars Program. Finally, I am a representative for Men
            Against Rape and Sexual Assault, a peer education organization that
            educates students in male-dominated campus organizations about
            sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention.
