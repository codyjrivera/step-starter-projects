      <h4>cuSZ</h4>
      <p>
        SZ is a lossy compression algorithm that is state-of-the-art with
        respect to both its compression ratios and accuracy. However, the
        algorithm as published is difficult to parallelize. cuSZ aims to
        implement this algorithm in parallel on the Nvidia CUDA GPU
        platform. The algorithm is comprised of an optimized parallel
        quantization phase and a parallel huffman coding phase, which is
        the focus of my work.
        This work was done under the supervision of Dr. Dingwen Tao, assistant
        professor of Computer Science at the University of Alabama. The
        research code will be released soon.

      <h4>ISM2</h4>
      <p>
        ISM2 is a parallel GPU algorithm that multiplies two irregularly-shaped
        matrices up to 3.3x faster than the state-of-the-art Nvidia CUBLAS
        linear algebra library. To be more specific, ISM2 is optimized for the
        case where one of the matrices has many rows and very few columns,
        e.g., 10240 x 16. My work specifically focused on adapting this
        algorithm to the Nvidia V100 GPU and generalizing a previous
        iteration, TSM2. This work was done under the supervision of 
        Dr. Dingwen Tao, assistant professor of Computer Science at the
        University of Alabama. The research code is published on Github,
        and we are submitting our manuscript to journals.

      <h4>Crimson-Scheme</h4>
      <p>
        Crimson-Scheme is a simple Scheme interpreter I wrote to explore
        programming language implementation. I implement the interpreter
        in object-oriented style with C++. Here, I implement a lexer,
        recursive-descent parser, and a simple interpreter/evaluator.
